# Quiz Game Project

This is a simple quiz game project implemented in Python. The game utilizes a list of true/false questions from the field of computer science. The user interacts with the game by answering each question, and the program provides feedback on correctness and keeps track of the score.

## Features:

- **Question Bank:** The project includes a set of true/false questions related to computer science extracted from https://opentdb.com/.
- **User Interaction:** Users can input their answers to each question through the console.
- **Scoring:** The program keeps track of the user's score based on correct answers.
- **Feedback:** Immediate feedback is provided after each user response.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.py` script.
3. Answer each question by typing 'True' or 'False' in the console.

## Project Structure:

- **main.py:** The main script to run the quiz game.
- **data.py:** Contains the list of true/false questions used in the game.
- **quiz_brain.py:** Implements the QuizBrain class, managing the game's logic.
- **question_model.py:** Defines the Question class to structure each quiz question.

## What I Learned:

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of basic Python concepts and object-oriented programming. Key takeaways include:

- List and class manipulation in Python.
- User input handling and validation.
- Building a simple interactive console-based application.

Feel free to explore and enhance the project based on your learning goals!
